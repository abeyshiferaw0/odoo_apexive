```

**AI Output Summary:**  
- Provided a markdown template to document AI usage.  
- Included sections: Models used, tools, key prompts, refinements.  
- Prepared for user customization.

**Refinements Made:**  
- User added own chat logs and prompts later.

- Created a Flutter `AppColors` class template with static `Color` fields (primary, secondary, accent, background, surface, error, text colors, etc.).  
- Included placeholders (`Color(0xFF000000)`) for actual hex colors.  
- Defined an `AppTheme` class with static getters for `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` returning `ThemeData` using those colors.

**Refinements Made:**  
- User planned to replace placeholders with real color hex values from their Figma palette.

Here are the two suggested additions in Markdown format, ready to be copied into your AI_USAGE.md file:

ðŸ”¸ Example Prompt 5

**Prompt:**  
```
I need a Bloc implementation in Flutter for creating a timer. The timer should have its own model class, which includes the following fields: project (String), task (String), description (String), isFavorite (bool), dueDate (DateTime). The Bloc should use HydratedBloc to persist the state across app restarts. The timer logic should include functionalities such as start, pause, resume, and stop. Also, it should be able to update created timers.

**AI Output Summary:**  
- Provided a complete Flutter project structure for a single timer application.
- Included a TimerModel class with specified fields and toJson/fromJson methods for HydratedBloc persistence.
- Implemented a TimerBloc with events for Start, Pause, Resume, Stop, and UpdateTimer.
- Designed a basic UI to display and control the single timer.
```

**Refinements Made:**  
- Later inquire about extending the functionality to support multiple timers, leading to further architectural changes.
